## :telescope: Overview
- This app is built with GPT-3.
- LLM-Write is the CLI tool for Intractive Automated Article Writing.  
- You can create articles, just answer the questions.   
- Since the language is specified in the LLM prompt and LLM is allowed to generate the text, it could theoretically be used in a variety of languages.  
    - However, the supported languages in the shell messages are only English and Japanese.
